CodeRoom is a distraction-free editor similar to WriteRoom, DarkRoom, PyRoom etc. CodeRoom supports syntax highlighting, which makes it useful for writing Latex or small coding projects, although currently only Latex and C++ (partially) highlighting is implemented. You are welcome to write your own highlighting schemes.

Features:
  * Distraction-free writing
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Customizable highlighting schemes
  * Lightweight editor with basic functionality
  * Customizable interface

CodeRoom is written in C++ using the Qt framework, and therefore should compile on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux and Mac.
